# Sudoku Generator and Solver

This project provides tools for generating, solving, and visualizing Sudoku puzzles using Python.

## Features

- Generate complete Sudoku boards
- Solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm
- Visualize the solving process in real-time
- Clear console utility for better visualization

## Usage

Run the main script to generate and visualize a Sudoku puzzle:

```
python sudoku_generator.py
```

## Algorithm

The Sudoku generator and solver use a backtracking algorithm:

1. Start with an empty 9x9 grid.
2. Try placing a number (1-9) in an empty cell.
3. Check if the number is valid in that position (doesn't violate Sudoku rules).
4. If valid, move to the next empty cell and repeat from step 2.
5. If not valid, or if we've tried all numbers, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.
6. Continue this process until the entire grid is filled (solution found) or all possibilities are exhausted (no solution).
